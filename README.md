# Notepad for my thoughts

1. Create a README
    1. Installation and user manual
2. Consider refactor of ```deck_names = []``` within ```get_learnable_cards()```
3. Replace useless return statements
	1. create and error module and serve when needed.
4. Can I legally use 'happy astronaut.jpg'
5. Check Licences of all dependences and list for guidance to deciding the licence of this repository.`
6. Notification UI
    1. Find ways (if any) for  better readabiliy.
7. Consider accessibility
8. If there's an alternative to Pushover to avoid the fee that would be great but I'm not convinced... Maybe I can shoulder the $5 myself? Or can make the installation easier. There's something on [Pushover.net](https://support.pushover.net`i37-including-an-open-source-application-s-api-token-in-its-source-code) about this.
9. Pre-release check
    1. Portability
    2. Test suite
    3. Distributions
10. Create ```topology.md``` with methods grouped by page and connection.
    1. Use **mermaid** and do this at the end.
11. An easily changable variable to set the maximum times a notification can be sent.
    1. It's written inside of config.py but still needs all the implementation.
12. Explore the idea of a dynamic crontab entry.
13. Problem with ```helpers.network_listener.head()``` that certain ips work and others do.
    1. Check router to diagnose
