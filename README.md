# Notepad for my thoughts

1. Create a README
2. Sort out ```get_deck_dict()``` for the love of God
    1. Maybe there's a different function instead of ```all_names_and_ids()``` ? Using ```popitem()``` seems very wrong.
3. Proper notification UI - readable and less clunky
4. If there's an alternative to Pushover to avoid the fee that would be great but I'm not convinced... Maybe I can shoulder the $5 myself? Or can make the installation easier. There's something on [Pushover.net](https://support.pushover.net/i37-including-an-open-source-application-s-api-token-in-its-source-code) about this.
5. Determine portability of the app
    1. Windows
    2. Mac
6. Inventory of all files for reference
7. Document setup requirements and how to use.
